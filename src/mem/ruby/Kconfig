                This shows up as `buildEnv["PROTOCOL"]`` for backwards
                compatibility, mostly in the Ruby.py config scripts.
                Otherwise, this is ignored.
                If this is set to anything when build with MULTIPLE,
                it will be ignored unless using Ruby.py, in which case
                the protocol specified here will appear as the only protocol.
                Note: This is case sensitive.
